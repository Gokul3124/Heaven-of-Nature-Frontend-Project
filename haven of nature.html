          <h1>Ecosystems</h1>
          <p>Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated
            way. The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.
            Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important
            components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.</p>

          <h1>Nature</h1>
          <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally,
            meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to Earth or some parts of Earth. This
            environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that
            affect human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished
            as components:</p>

      <h1>DO's</h1>

      <li>
        Run in a jagged line if a crocodile or alligator attacks you. If a crocodile charges out of a swamp or overgrown
        lake and starts to charge, pick a direction and run as fast as you can. Adult alligators and crocs can only run
        about 18–20 miles per hour (29–32 km/h), so most adults should be able to outrun a crocodile. Large reptiles
        aren’t built for long-distance chases, so it will quickly lose interest in catching you.If the crocodile or
        alligator catches you in its jaws, poke and kick it as hard as possible in the eyes.Running in a zig-zag pattern
        to escape from a crocodile is a common misconception. While it won't necessarily hurt your chances of surviving
        an attack, it's just not necessary.</li>

      <li>Intimidate an attacking dog by shouting loudly and throwing rocks. If 1 or 2 dogs (domestic or wild) are
        showing aggression towards you, stand your ground. Make yourself appear as large as you can, shout, and throw
        rocks (or anything at hand) at the dogs. If a whole pack is threatening you, you may need to run for safety if
        protection is less than 20 feet (6.1 m) away. Since dogs can’t climb, try to get on top of a boulder or other
        large object.If they continue the attack, try fighting them off with your hands or a large stick.
        Don’t bother trying to run from an attacking pack of wild dogs, since they hunt in packs and can easily outrun
        and corner you.Fortunately, though, wild dogs seldom show an interest in attacking humans. If you leave them
        alone, they’ll leave you alone.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="act2">

      <h1>DONT's</h1>

      <li>Never provoke, harass or interfere with crocodiles, even small ones. Never feed crocodiles — it is illegal and
        dangerous. Be extra vigilant around water at night and during the breeding season from September to April. Avoid
        approaching the edge of the water and don't paddle or wade at the edge of the water.Don’t swim in waters known
        to have crocs. This is a no brainer, but if there is a sign that states they are around, it’s likely there for a
        reason.Avoid swimming at dusk or night in croc country – crocodiles often hunt at these times. Even if crocs
        aren’t
        supposed to be there, you should swim with caution at these times.</li>

      <li>If you see a dog that looks agitated and is running towards you, the most important thing is not to react or
        scream. Stay calm and avoid eye contact. Move away (out of their space) as calmly and slowly as possible. If a
        dog is attacking in full flight, best to stay upright, remain still and call for help Strong citrus scents are
        unpleasant for your dog and may deter them from digging up your plants or specific areas in the yard. You can
        also use this tactic for indoor plants that your dog is digging around in. Citrus scents are excellent for
        deterring your dog from areas you don't want them to get into.</li>
